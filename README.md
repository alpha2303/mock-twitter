# mock-twitter

## Introduction
  This is an application built for implementing some of the concepts and techniques of the React Native framework, partnered with Nativebase UI toolkit for RN. It's a mock layout of the standard Twitter app.
  
  React Native allows developers to create cross-platform applications for Android and iOS simultaneously (Code once, deploy to many). 

## Instructions
  To be able to use the app code, you must first have react-native set up on your device. For full set-up and instructions to run the app, visit the RN documentation: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html 
  
  Please make sure you check the "Building Project with Native Code" section of above site and not the "Quick Start" section.
  
## Assistance Required
  As React Native is still quite new to learn, there are quite a few imperfections in this app, prime of which are:
  
   1.) Moving Search bar in Tab content to parent Component's header.
   
   2.) Icon size in Drawer not increasing.
   
   3.) Slight UI polishing
   
  If contributions or suggestions can be done to improve this code for study purposes by those experienced in the above frameworks, it would be highly appreciated.
